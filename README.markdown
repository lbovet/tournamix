This code reads 8 teams from teams.txt and serves a mini app for runing a "binary" sport tournament.
In a binary tournament, all n teams play n/2 matches. The winner wins 2^round points at each
round. Thus at the end, all teams have different number of points.

The code can be easily modified to model usual types of tournaments (trees) but not groups (pools).
